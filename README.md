This package provides a TCP client node for Node-RED, enabling connections to designated hosts. It serves as a replacement for the deprecated node-red-contrib-tcp-client by Tiago Costa.

## Description
The TCP client node allows seamless integration of TCP connections within Node-RED flows. It provides flexibility in establishing dynamic connections and transmitting data over TCP protocols.

## Features
- Establish TCP connections with designated hosts.
- Dynamically manage connections using provided arguments.
- Transmit data over TCP ports with ease.

## Usage
Example usage scenarios:
1. Monitoring data from remote sensors over TCP/IP.
2. Integrating with external systems via TCP communication.
3. Building custom TCP-based protocols within Node-RED flows.

## Installation:
You can install this package either by using `npm install node-red-contrib-tcp-client --save` in ~./node-red or through the Palette Manager in Node-RED.

Upon successful installation, you should find the new TCP client node under the network category.
