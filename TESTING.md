# Testing

## Overview

The testing for node-red-contrib-tcp-client primarily consists of happy path testing to ensure basic functionality and reliability. 

## Test Cases

### Case 1: Establish TCP Connection
1. Open Node-RED.
2. Drag and drop the TCP client node onto the flow.
3. Configure the node to establish a TCP connection with a designated host and port.
4. Deploy the flow.
5. Verify that the TCP connection is successfully established.

### Case 2: Transmit Data
1. Follow the steps from Case 1 to establish a TCP connection.
2. Configure the node to transmit data over the established TCP connection.
3. Deploy the flow.
4. Send test data to the node.
5. Verify that the node successfully transmits the data over the TCP connection.

### Case 3: Close Connection
1. Follow the steps from Case 1 to establish a TCP connection.
2. Configure the node to close the TCP connection.
3. Deploy the flow.
4. Verify that the TCP connection is successfully closed.

## Running Tests

The tests described above can be executed manually within the Node-RED environment. Additionally, automated tests may be implemented in the future to further validate the functionality of the TCP client node.

## Additional Testing

For comprehensive testing and validation of the TCP client node, consider performing integration tests with various configurations, edge cases, and error scenarios.
